    <p>Students may, in the first instance, discuss their concerns with their supervisor who is drawn from the department’s academic staff. The supervisor can assist with various aspects of academic life at Oxford. Practical concerns related to the courses may be directed to the Course Director and administrative concerns can be directed to the Course Coordinator or Graduate Studies Manager.
